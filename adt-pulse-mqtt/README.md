# adt-pulse-mqtt
ADT Pulse bridge for Home Assistant using MQTT. 

Integrates ADT Pulse with Home Assistant. You can also choose to add the ADT Pulse alarm system and ADT devices to your SmartThings. SmartApp allows automatic running our Routines upon alarm changing states.

## Home Assistant Setup 
- First, add the repository (https://github.com/adt-pulse-mqtt/hassio) using the Add-on Store in the Home Assistant Supervisor. This is the easiest way to run this add-on, but it can also run as an independent container using Docker. In both cases, communication is through MQTT.
- Install ADT Pulse MQTT from the store. Don't forget to configure `pulse_login` with your ADT Pulse Portal username and password. A separate login for Home Assistant is recommended. 
- Configure Add-on Options

### ADT Pulse Options
The pulse_login options are:

- username: The ADT Pulse Portal Username
- password:  The ADT Pulse Portal Password
- fingerprint: The fingerprint of trusted device authenticated with 2-factor authentication (see below)

### 2-Factor Authentication
ADT Pulse now requires 2-factor authentication and you will need to provide a device fingerprint:

1. Open a Chrome browser tab
2. Open Developer Tools (using **View** ➜ **Developer** ➜ **Developer Tools** menu)
3. Click on the **Network** tab (make sure **Preserve log** checkbox is checked)
4. In the filter box, enter **signin.jsp**
5. Go to ADT Pulse Portal (https://portal.adtpulse.com) and login to your account
6. Click on the network call (beginning with `signin.jsp`) appearing in the DevTools window
7. In the **Headers** tab, under **Form Data**, copy the entire **fingerprint** (after `fingerprint:`, do not include spaces)
8. Paste the copied text into the `fingerprint` field into your `config.json`

### MQTT Options
You'll need an MQTT broker. The Mosquitto add-on broker (https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/mosquitto/) is the easiest to implement.

In most cases, only the mqtt_options are needed:
  - mqtt_host: core-mosquitto (if using Mosquitto add-on, otherwise hostname or IP address)
  - mqtt_connection_options: 
    - username: MQTT broker username
    - password: MQTT broker password

In most cases, these options are sufficient. Alternatively, the mqtt_url can be specified instead which allows more advanced configurations (see https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt#connect).

### Home Assistant Configuration
This add-on uses the Home Assistant integrations for MQTT Alarm Control Panel and MQTT Binary Sensor.

 Ton configure these, you must edit your configuration.yaml:

To add the control panel:

<pre>alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "ADT Pulse"
    state_topic: "home/alarm/state"
    command_topic: "home/alarm/cmd"
    payload_arm_home: "arm_home"
    payload_arm_away: "arm_away"
    payload_disarm: "disarm"
</pre>

After running the add-on, get a list all the zones found. There are a couple of ways to do this, but they all involve subscribing to the wildcard topic "adt/zones/#".

I recommend the MQTT Snooper app on Android or just use the mosquito command-line command:

<pre>
# mosquitto_sub -h YOUR_MQTT_IP -v -t "adt/zone/#"
</pre>

Once you know the names of MQTT topics for your zones, add the following to the configuration.yaml for each zone in binary_sensor:

<pre>
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Kitchen Door"
    state_topic: "adt/zone/Kitchen Door/state"
    payload_on: "devStatOpen"
    payload_off: "devStatOK"
    device_class: door
    retain: true
</pre>

This will provide basic support for door sensors. You can add additional binary sensors for other possible state values. As an example, you can add support for a low battery condition on a sensor.
<pre>
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Kitchen Door Sensor Battery"
    state_topic: "adt/zone/Kitchen Door/state"
    payload_on: "devStatLowBatt"
    payload_off: "devStatOK"
    device_class: battery
</pre>

Note: State topic names come from your Pulse configuration.

The possible state values are:

  * devStatOK (device okay)
  * devStatOpen (door/window opened)
  * devStatMotion (detected motion)
  * devstatLowBatt: (low battery condition)
  * devStatTamper (glass broken or device tamper)
  * devStatAlarm (detected CO/Smoke)
  * devStatUnknown (device offline)

If a device type is not listed, open an issue containing your MQTT dump which lists your zones.

## Smartthings Support

* In Hassio, setting of the ADT Pulse MQTT set

<pre>
"smartthings": true
</pre>

* In SmartThings IDE,

1. add the following devicehandlers:
https://github.com/adt-pulse-mqtt/adt-pulse-mqtt/tree/master/devicetypes/haruny/VirtualADTAlarmSystem.src 
1. add the following SmartApp: 
https://github.com/adt-pulse-mqtt/adt-pulse-mqtt/tree/master/smartapps/haruny/ADTAlarmSmartApp.src
1. Add your devices using SmartThings IDE. You have to name them the same way they appear in ADT Portal.
1. Run the SmartApp in your mobile application. Follow the instructions. Do not rename ADT Alarm System device created by the app. Multiple alarm systems/locations is not supported.
1. In MQTT Bridge app, select all the devices created (Alarm system, contacts, motion etc.)

## Docker Compose
If you want to run this add-on independently using Docker, here is a sample Docker Compose file:

```
version: '3'
services:
   pulse-adt-mqtt:
      container_name: pulse-adt-mqtt
      image: adtpulsemqtt/adt-pulse-mqtt
      network_mode: host
      restart: always
      volumes:
       - /local/path/to/config-directory:/data
```
Sample config.json placed in the config-directory:
```
{
    "pulse_login" : {
        "username": "username",
        "password": "password"
    },
    "mqtt_host" : "mqtt_host"
    "mqtt_connect_options" :  {
      "username" : "username",
      "password" : "password",
      },
    "alarm_state_topic": "home/alarm/state",
    "alarm_command_topic": "home/alarm/cmd",
    "zone_state_topic": "adt/zone",
    "smartthings_topic": "smartthings",
    "smartthings": false
}
```
